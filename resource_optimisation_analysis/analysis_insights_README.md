## Business Recommendations

Based on insights from guest behaviour and wait time trends, the following strategies are proposed to improve operational efficiency and guest satisfaction:

- **Cross-train staff for flexible deployment**
    - Enable staff to take on multiple roles and assign **floating staff** based on model-driven demand forecasts. This ensures surge coverage without increasing overall headcount.

- **Leverage self-service kiosks for F&B**
    - Reduce dependency on fixed F&B manpower by **deploying kiosks** in high-traffic areas, lowering labour costs while maintaining service levels.

- **Engage part-time support during peaks**
    - During **school holidays, weekends, and special events**, bring in **part-timers** to support operations without incurring long-term staffing commitments.

These measures work hand-in-hand with the **staff optimisation model**, ensuring demand-responsive staffing while controlling operational expenditure.
