## Goal
The goal is to do a sentiment analysis on the reviews from Tripadvisor regarding Universal Studios Singapore (USS). We hope to identify what guests liked and identify pain points that can be potentially tackled.

### Data Cleaning:

First, we read the file and dropped some less useful columns. The columns dropped are Review Id, Display Name, User Name, User Profile, User Avatar, User Is Verified, Additional Ratings, Photos, Location Id, URL, Created Date, Published Date and Location.
